# Analysis of Missing Migrants Data
This is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Missing Migrants Project [database](https://missingmigrants.iom.int/downloads). 
The goal of this EDA is twofold. First, it serves to bring attention to the plight of migrants seeking safety. Secondly, its a means for me to practice EDA as a beginner.
